# bootstrap4-webpack3-boilerplate

Boilerplate for bootstrap 4 using webpack 3.

## Prerequisites
- [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/)

If you don't yet have nodejs installed and you are running mac os, I suggest using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) (node version manger), which makes managing different node versions a breeze.


## Usage

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:mihaerzen/bootstrap4-webpack3-boilerplate.git
```

Cd into the project folder

```bash
cd bootstrap4-webpack3-boilerplate
```

Install node modules

```bash
npm install
```

Build production

```bash
npm run build:prod
```

## Development

For development you can use `webpack-dev-server` by running:

```bash
npm run serve
```

For demo purposes I've copied the [bootstrap 4 album example](https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/examples/album).
